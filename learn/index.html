            <h1><a href="http://thirstyhead.com/mean-architecture-2.0/">MEAN Architecture 2.0</a></h1>

            <p>The phrase "MEAN Stack" -- short for MongoDB, Express, Angular,
              and Node -- is only a few years old. In that time, it has quickly
              become convenient shorthand to describe a modern web technology
              stack that features a NoSQL database and pervasive JavaScript
              across all tiers of the app. "MEAN" is also a way to contrast
              your tech stack with the older, more traditional "LAMP Stack"
              that includes Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Perl/Python/PHP.</p>

            <p>While expressive, MEAN may not be expressive enough to fully
              describe the architectural patterns in play in your application:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Is your app fully server-side, fully client-side (the
                fashionable Serverless pattern), or does it split the
                responsibilities between the client and the server?</li>
              <li>Is your app a Single Page App (SPA), or a more traditional
                multi-page app?</li>
              <li>Does it offer equivalent functionality when both online and
                offline?</li>
              <li>Can it replicate the user experience of native mobile apps
                written in Objective-C, Swift, or Java with only HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript? This recently introduced architecture --
                popularly called a Progressive Web App (PWA) -- features the
                PRPL Pattern (Push, Render, Pre-cache, and Lazy Load), Service
                Workers, and a preference for HTTP/2.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>And how about your data lifecycle?</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Is your dataset so large and frequently updated that it must
                live solely in the Cloud?</li>
              <li>Can it be cached on the client side for occasional offline
                use, or even better -- fully synchronized between the client
                and the Cloud so that your user has a comparable experience
                both in and out of Airplane Mode?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In this workshop, Scott Davis (author/presenter of O'Reilly
              videos <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920039495.do">Architecture of the MEAN Stack</a>,

              presents several
              common web architectures for MEAN apps and the corresponding
              production-ready libraries and frameworks that will help you
              implement them. You will leave this workshop with a better
              understanding of what is possible within the broad definition of
              the MEAN stack, and how you can most quickly reach your goals
              with popular standards-based, open source solutions.</p>

            <p>
              A typical user experience these days moves seamlessly between smartphones,
              tablets, laptops, and even smart TVs without us even thinking about it.
              Google calls this our new "Multi-Screen World". Netflix, Amazon Prime,
              Facebook, and Twitter are examples of services that we use on a daily basis
              that flow like water across all of the glass screens in our life.
            </p>

            <p>
              But what if there is no screen? What if your User Interface is talking to
              your wrist, or talking to thin air as you walk into a room? Gartner predicts
              that 30% of all interactions with computers will be done with your voice by 2018.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this talk, Scott Davis (author/presenter of the O'Reilly video series
              <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920039495.do">Architecture of the MEAN Stack</a>) helps break down what Conversational UIs are,
              and how you can adopt them in your application. As we explore real world examples
              and APIs that you can begin using today, you'll quickly learn that calling this
              "Artificial Intelligence" is a bit premature. But it's still pretty darn cool,
              and something you should be paying attention to today...
