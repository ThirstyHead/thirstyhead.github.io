            <h1>From Relational Databases to NoSQL</h1>
            <p class="watch-conference"><a href="http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/">Great Indian Developer Summit (GIDS)</a>, 2015</p>
            <hr>

            <p>The term "NoSQL" (either "No SQL" or "Not Only SQL" dependending on how upset you are with traditional relational databases) has been around for over 15 years. NoSQL solutions are no more of a "golden hammer" than relational databases -- it's important to recognize circumstances when one is more appropriate than the other.</p>
            <p>In this talk, Scott Davis (author of the IBM developerWorks series "Mastering MEAN") will give you a pragmatic overview of the strengths and weaknesses of current popular NoSQL solutions like CouchDB and MongoDB. Persistence stores such as these do a better job of mirroring Agile software practices like emergent design.</p>
            <p>If you treat NoSQL solutions as a drop-in replacement for your current relational database, you're going to have a bad day. We'll talk about document-orientation vs. rows and columns, composition vs. joins, and eventual consistency vs. transactions.</p>
            <p>Join Scott to see if a NoSQL solution is appropriate for your application.</p>

            <h1>Testing the MEAN Stack</h1>
            <p class="watch-conference"><a href="http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/">Great Indian Developer Summit (GIDS)</a>, 2015</p>
            <hr>

            <p>With apologies to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I look to a day when new web frameworks will not be judged by how easy they make development, but by how easy they make testing. Our industry has proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that you can slap together a Todo list (or a Twitter client, or or or...) in 60 minutes or less using the latest framework de jour. But who would really want to put that slapdash, hacked-together, un-tested mess into production without a solid testing infrastructure backing it up?</p>
            <p>In this talk, Scott Davis (author of the IBM developerWorks series "Mastering MEAN") will demonstrate a comprehensive testing stack for the MEAN stack. We'll start with a couple of testing libraries -- JasmineJS and MochaJS -- that support both TDD (Test-Driven Development) and BDD (Behavior-Driven Development). Next we'll explore KarmaJS -- a test runner that runs your tests across an array of browsers (including headless browsers like PhantomJS and SlimerJS), operating systems, and mobile devices. We'll discuss the value of the code-coverage reports provided by IstanbulJS, and the power of driving your browser programmatically (filling in form fields, clicking links, etc.) using the functional testing library ProtractorJS.</p>
            <p>Come see how easy it is to do professional, world-class software development -- and by that, of course, I mean how easy it is to test your codebase end-to-end.</p>

            <h1>Exploring Vert.x in Java, Groovy, and JavaScript</h1>
            <p class="watch-conference"><a href="http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/">Great Indian Developer Summit (GIDS)</a>, 2015</p>

            <p>If you're a JavaScript developer, you'd be hard pressed to find a more popular platform than NodeJS these days. But what if you're a Java developer looking for something more than the usual JEE or Spring stack? Maybe Vert.x is what you're looking for.</p>
            <p>Vert.x is written in Java and designed for the JVM, but its development model is anything but Java-centric. Vert.x takes an asynchronous, event-driven view of the world that can be quite a departure for traditional synchronous Java programs. And most interestingly, Vert.x offers polyglot solutions in Java, Groovy, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and more. </p>
            <p>Come get a solid introduction to Vert.x from Scott Davis (author of the IBM developerWorks series "Mastering MEAN"), and see if it's a good fit for your next project.</p>

            <p>"Everyone talks about the weather, but no one ever does anything about it." - Mark Twain.</p>
            <p>Do you feel that way about testing? Is testing a job for someone else? Would you write more tests if you had the right tools?</p>
            <p>In this keynote, Scott Davis (author of the IBM developerWorks series "Mastering MEAN") talks about how software testing is a crucial part of the development process. But it is more than a drudgery or a chore -- with the right tools in place, you can gain incredible insight into how your application ACTUALLY works (as opposed to how you THINK it works). </p>
            <p>If you think that testing is just for finding bugs after the fact, come see how modern software developers use these testing tools to drive the design and fuel the development process.</p>

            <h1>RESTful Web Services in Grails 2.3</h1>
            <p class="watch-conference"><a href="http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/">Great Indian Developer Summit (GIDS)</a>, 2014</p>
            <hr>

            <p>No modern web application is complete without offering RESTful web services that return XML, JSON, or both. Any hopes of using a client-side Javascript MVC framework like AngularJS or BackboneJS will be thwarted without a steady stream of life-giving web services.</p>
            <p>In this talk, Scott Davis will show you the vastly improved / vastly simplified RESTful offerings in Grails 2.3. You'll learn how to use cURL to explore and test any web services (not just Grails-based) from the command line. And most importantly, you'll learn both the semantics AND the syntax behind RESTful web services.</p>

            <p>Kick PowerPoint to the curb! Ditch that proprietary (but oh so beautiful!) Keynote. Modern HTML5 browsers now have the power and sophistication to replace these presentation software mainstays. </p>
            <p>In this talk, Scott Davis will show you three different HTML presentation frameworks. We'll start with the tried-and-true warhorse Slidy.js -- a framework developed by the W3C that has been around for nearly a decade and runs on every legacy browser on the planet. Next, we'll use AsciiDoc and Deck.js for a wiki-like slide creation experience. Finally, we'll use Yeoman and Reveal.js to create a fully modern HTML5 web experience that runs on everything from smartphones to tablets, from laptops to desktops, and everything in-between. Reveal.js even leverages SocketIO to keep remote browsers in sync with your presentation as you change slides!</p>

            <p>In the late 20th century, web developers talked about using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl) for building professional websites with open-source software. 15 years later, we have a new acronym that's gaining popularity -- the MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS).</p>
            <p>In this talk, you'll learn how each one of these pieces of technology complement each other. But this is more than a simple change in letters -- the move from relational databases to NoSQL and from server-side MVC to client-side MVC represents a major shift in architecture and mental models. </p>
            <p>Come see how these four independent pieces of technology work together to form the "new way" of doing web development. </p>

            <p>As a web developer, I'm always looking for tools that "script away" the boring part of the project -- building, scaffolding, testing, minifying, etc. Historically, this problem was solved by bespoke scripts that shipped with individual frameworks. But the "new framework / new workflow" grind gets old after the third or fourth time.</p>
            <p>Enter Yeoman -- a collection of best-of-breed tools that streamline your workflow and -- wait for it -- can be reused across projects / frameworks. Yo scaffolds out new projects; Grunt builds and tests your project; Bower tackles dependency management for importing third-party libraries.</p>
            <p>Come catch a glimpse of how a modern, reusable workflow can increase your developer velocity.</p>

            <p class="watch-conference"><a href="http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/">Great Indian Developer Summit (GIDS)</a>, 2014</p>
            <hr>

            <p>I have a 12 year old son who is beginning his career as a software developer. But regardless of how many years we've been in this industry, every time we learn a new language, a new framework, or a new library, we're "young" software developers all over again.</p>
            <p>When I'm learning something new (and I'm ALWAYS learning something new), I follow the same three steps: 1. Learn to type; 2. Learn to think; 3. Learn to see the future. In this talk, I'll show you tools and utilities to help out with the mechanics of learning something new, as well as rubrics and techniques. Trust me: no matter how "young" you really are, this talk will help you as you move forward in your career as a software developer. </p>
