            <h1>From Relational Databases to NoSQL</h1>
            <p class="watch-conference"><a href="http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/">Great Indian Developer Summit (GIDS)</a>, 2015</p>
            <hr>

            <p>The term "NoSQL" (either "No SQL" or "Not Only SQL" dependending on how upset you are with traditional relational databases) has been around for over 15 years. NoSQL solutions are no more of a "golden hammer" than relational databases -- it's important to recognize circumstances when one is more appropriate than the other.</p>
            <p>In this talk, Scott Davis (author of the IBM developerWorks series "Mastering MEAN") will give you a pragmatic overview of the strengths and weaknesses of current popular NoSQL solutions like CouchDB and MongoDB. Persistence stores such as these do a better job of mirroring Agile software practices like emergent design.</p>
            <p>If you treat NoSQL solutions as a drop-in replacement for your current relational database, you're going to have a bad day. We'll talk about document-orientation vs. rows and columns, composition vs. joins, and eventual consistency vs. transactions.</p>
            <p>Join Scott to see if a NoSQL solution is appropriate for your application.</p>

            <h1>Testing the MEAN Stack</h1>
            <p class="watch-conference"><a href="http://www.developermarch.com/developersummit/">Great Indian Developer Summit (GIDS)</a>, 2015</p>
            <hr>

            <p>With apologies to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I look to a day when new web frameworks will not be judged by how easy they make development, but by how easy they make testing. Our industry has proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that you can slap together a Todo list (or a Twitter client, or or or...) in 60 minutes or less using the latest framework de jour. But who would really want to put that slapdash, hacked-together, un-tested mess into production without a solid testing infrastructure backing it up?</p>
            <p>In this talk, Scott Davis (author of the IBM developerWorks series "Mastering MEAN") will demonstrate a comprehensive testing stack for the MEAN stack. We'll start with a couple of testing libraries -- JasmineJS and MochaJS -- that support both TDD (Test-Driven Development) and BDD (Behavior-Driven Development). Next we'll explore KarmaJS -- a test runner that runs your tests across an array of browsers (including headless browsers like PhantomJS and SlimerJS), operating systems, and mobile devices. We'll discuss the value of the code-coverage reports provided by IstanbulJS, and the power of driving your browser programmatically (filling in form fields, clicking links, etc.) using the functional testing library ProtractorJS.</p>
            <p>Come see how easy it is to do professional, world-class software development -- and by that, of course, I mean how easy it is to test your codebase end-to-end.</p>
