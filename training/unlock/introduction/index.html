           <p>Hi! My name is Scott Davis. I'm currently a Principle Engineer with ThoughtWorks. Before that, I ran a software consultancy out of Denver  called ThirstyHead. </p>

           <p>I've been writing about web development for years -- articles for IBM, books for O'Reilly and the Pragmatic Bookshelf, and most recently videos for O'Reilly as well.</p>

        <h2>Browser-Native<br>Web Development</h2>
        <figure>
          <p>If you've been doing web development at any point during the past 20 years, you almost certainly have taken a <span class="highlight">framework-first</span> approach.</p>

          <p>Today, we'll take a <span class="highlight">browser-native</span> approach -- pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>


          <figcaption>
            <p>By "framework-first", I mean the first thing you decide for any new project is which framework you'll use.</p>

            <p>Browser-native technologies are purpose-built for web development -- they are baked into the brower, requiring no additional downloads or configuration.</p>

            <p>If any of the technologies you mention are native to the browser, I'll be pleasantly surprised.</p>

            <p>By "general purpose", I mean "not web-specific". Logically, if your programming language wasn't built for the web, you have to bring the web to your programming language in the form of libraries, packages, or frameworks.</p>

            <p>Quick question: have you ever used Java for non-web purposes? Ruby? C#?</p>

            <p>Difficult question: are these languages best suited for web development if they require additional external resources?</p>

          <figcaption>
            <p>It amazes me that these languages were intentially, specifically built for web development, yet they are not first on the list of technologies that web developers reach for when they need to do some web development.</p>

            <p>I recently worked with an incredibly sharp devops specialist. He was able to set up a private GitLab installation, complete with VPN and private authentication. He struggled setting up a simple web server.</p>

            <p>Backend developers seem to be among the most offended by these observations. No one says, "I'm studying monads in Erlang, but there's no way I'll ever be able smart enough to understand CSS."</p>

            <p>No one would ever say, "Scala? That's easy. You should be able to pick it up without any training. You can learn it as you go." Now swap out "Scala" or "Closure" for "CSS", "JavaScript", or even "HTML"...</p>
